                <h3 class="slide-caption">1. Our Pastures:</h3>
                <p class="slide-text"> Our farm, located in upstate New York just 30 miles from the city, is a 
                    self-sustaining system where we grow our fresh produce and raise our animals. The healthy 
                    cows graze freely on open pastures, allowing them to move naturally and live comfortably. 
                    This type of grazing also helps the environment by spreading manure across the land, adding 
                    nutrients to the soil. It supports stronger plant growth, helps soil microbes thrive, and 
                    even stores more carbon in the ground, making the land healthier. Our farm also includes 
                    pastures for raising hens, with clean coops and outdoor areas for foraging. This setup helps 
                    maintain healthy chickens and better-quality eggs while allowing us to naturally manage food 
                    scraps. In addition to our pasture space, we grow a variety of fruit trees in climate-controlled 
                    greenhouses, which allow us to harvest year-round. During the warmer months, our tropical 
                    greenhouse supports calamansi trees and coconut trees, which are used in many of our desserts 
                    and signature dishes.

                <h3 class="slide-caption">2. Innovative Growth:</h3>
                <p class="slide-text">Our farm uses advanced hydroponic systems and greenhouses to grow 
                    fresh produce efficiently and sustainably. By using vertical hydroponic technology, 
                    we reduce land use by up to 99% and water use by 98% compared to traditional farming 
                    methods. Hydroponics doesn’t rely on soil, so it avoids problems like erosion, tilling, 
                    and nutrient runoff. Our enclosed greenhouses also protect nearby land by keeping pests out, 
                    eliminating the need for chemical pesticides and harmful runoff. Besides keeping pests 
                    out, our crops are also shielded from unpredictable weather and contamination, giving us 
                    a consistent year-round harvest. Hydroponic technology also improves our consistency by 
                    establishing a controlled environment where we can monitor our plants and deliver them a 
                    carefully balanced mix of nutrients—like nitrogen, phosphorus, and calcium—directly through 
                    he water. This leads to faster growth and higher crop yields, 240 times greater than traditional 
                    farming, while also reducing waste from spoilage, runoff, and overuse of inputs.

                <p class="slide-text">
                    Agriculture and the food supply chain contribute between 21% and 37% of global CO₂ emissions. 
                    By sourcing our ingredients directly from a farm located just 30 miles away, we significantly 
                    reduce the need for long-distance transportation. This helps us minimize fuel consumption, 
                    packaging waste, and refrigeration needs. We are also able to serve our customers fresh food 
                    that does not depend on energy-intensive preservation methods. Our staff also actively works 
                    to minimize food waste by collecting leftover produce and scraps, which are returned to the 
                    farm to be composted. This composting process not only keeps food out of landfills, where it 
                    would have released methane—a greenhouse gas over 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide—but 
                    also turns waste into something useful for the soil. By closing the loop between our restaurant 
                    and farm, we reduce emissions, limit waste, and contribute to a more balanced and environmentally 
                    responsible food system.

                <p class="slide-text">Embêr promotes sustainability. At our restaurant, food waste is collected and 
                    separated. Dairy waste is disposed of and vegetable waste is thrown into bins and taken back to 
                    our farms. Vegetable waste taken from our restaurant is allowed to decompose over time, becoming 
                    compost rich in nutrients. Compost made at our farm is applied to soil used in our farms and 
                    greenhouses. The nutrient-rich compost allows us to grow the necessary vegetables needed for 
                    our restaurant as well as the crops used to feed our livestock! Staying committed to regenerative 
                    farming, we collect organic waste from our restaurant and turn it into compost. This compost is 
                    used throughout the farm to support plant growth and improve soil without relying on synthetic 
                    fertilizers. By recycling nutrients and keeping outside inputs low, we reduce our environmental 
                    impact and create a balanced system where animals, plants, and food waste all work together to 
                    support long-term sustainability.

                At Ember, we strive to give our customers the best taste, starting with how our food 
                is prepared. While we are a fusion restaurant focused on innovative taste, we still 
                want each dish to embody what came before it. We use traditional cooking techniques and 
                ingredients to ensure that our dishes maintain bits of identity from the cuisines we 
                fuse. For example, woks and grills are utilized for stir-frying. Dumplings and Dim Sum 
                are prepared by hand to ensure quality. 
            </p>
            <p class="prep-paragraph2">
                For our cutlery and cooking utensils, everything is reusable. Each item is also hand-washed 
                by our staff, whose goal is always sanitation. As per New York City Regulations, we always 
                follow the necessary sanitary processes to ensure our food does not spread harmful bacteria 
                or diseases. Our equipment, such as woks and pans, is frequently washed. Specific pans are 
                also designated for allergens to ensure we avoid cross-contamination. With food hygiene 
                inspections every 6-12 months by the NYC Health Department, we can guarantee your food is 
                prepared with the highest sanitation standards.
            </p>
